```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


## This line is amazing and I will tell you why...it helps when knitting externally so you can still interactively run code with root paths!


knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("../")) 


## NOTE: This only works for paths INSIDE of code chunks


```


# RMarkdown


Rather than go through every detail of RMarkdown and it's wonderfully simple but extensive functionality, I'd rather **bewilder** you with a bunch of examples, give you some examples you can play with, and include a lot of links you can check out on your own time.

## Code Chunks


When inserting and running code chunks in `.Rmd` files, you can can add controls for many things. In RNotebooks, this extends to some nice options to show/hide code in the html file.


Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 


**Play with the Code chunk options**


```{r cars plot again again again, echo=TRUE}


plot(cars, pch=21, col="black", bg="maroon")


```


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}


plot(cars, pch=21, col="black", bg="maroon")


```


```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.subcap="A lot of Speed vs. Distance", fig.cap="Yet Another Cars Plot", fig.width=7}


plot(cars, pch=21, col="black", bg="salmon", cex=1.5)


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).


### Adding More Stuff


Here's another crazy figure/cartoon or something.


```{r, ggplot thing}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, color=Species, group=Species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```


Well that's cool! **It actually works!**
